Nominatim is designed primarily for finding individual locations by name or address, not listing all POIs of a given type in an area. It is just one of many different searches that can use osm data, each has their advantage/disadvantage  It offers a layer=railway filter, which allows matching of railway infrastructure (such as railways), but very few stations are indexed in its database—so results may be incomplete even if you use the correct filters  Best Approach: Use the Overpass API  Overpass Turbo Wizard (beginner option)  Go to overpass-turbo.eu, open the Wizard, and enter: railway=station in Singapore  It will translate into a full Overpass QL query and show all nodes/ways tagged railway=station within Singapore."

Although they might take two or more sessions, they provide comfort and aesthetics. On the first visit, the targeted area is prepped and impressions of the teeth are made. The final product is fabricated from either composite or porcelain in the course of a week or two. After that the patient goes back to Dennis Tan to have the items set in place with glue or cement. Porcelain veneers are usually used for aesthetic purposes but they are also capable of covering chips and cracks, therefore making the teeth stronger and more durable.
