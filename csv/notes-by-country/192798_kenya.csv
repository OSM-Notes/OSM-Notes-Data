I know because I live there.  If you visit google maps, you will see schools, churches, and shopping centers named 'Matasia.'  The misspelling originated in a typo on a Kenya government map.  But the street sign when you enter the village is 'Matasia.'  The local form of the name (in the Maa language of the Maasai people) is 'Enoomatasiani' which means 'place of the matasia bushes.'  All of that extra is just to show that I'm not randomly making this up.  Can someone please correct this typo and change 'Matathia' to 'MATASIA'?  Thanks!",2,0,Rps333,done
