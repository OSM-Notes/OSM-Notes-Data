They find their way into our homes through cracks or by creating a hole by themselves. They create mud tubes while they are inside the home, it gives them protection from other predators, and this tube is used to transfer cellulose from food source to their colonies.   They feed onto wooden structures and collect cellulose. The damage done by the termites can cost a lot to repair. So, it is important to find the termite infestation as soon as possible to minimize the damage. Ensure is one of the best pest control service providers for termite control Dubai.
