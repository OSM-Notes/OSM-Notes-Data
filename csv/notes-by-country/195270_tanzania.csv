Il est située dans le nord de la Tanzanie, dans la branche Ouest de la vallée du Grand Rift. C'est maintenant un parc national, avec beaucoup de faune et de flore. Le cratère est inscrit au Patrimoine de l'humanité de l'Unesco. Le cratère c'est formé il y a 2,5 millions d'années. Etant donné les pluies, un lac c'est formé à l'intérieur du cratère. Ce lac attire donc la faune sauvage, ce Lac est donc magnifique du à toute cette diversité    Il y a trois lodges  qui  se trouvent sur les bords du cratère et y organisent des excursions la journée et la nuit afin d'y observer la faune sauvage.  Des excursions dans ce cratère sont organisés sous forme de safaris pour être 'au contact' des animaux  On peut observer des lions, des buffles, des zèbres, des girafes ...

Residents have shared their concerns with loss of identity, quality of life and infrastructure overcapacities related to demolitions and building of new high-rises. City council and other planning bodies (e.g. National Housing Corporation) release little to no official information about the topic and demolitions usually take place over the weekend, when courts cannot be summoned for an injunction. Over the past few years thousands of tenants have been expropriated. There is no clear proof of the advantages of demolition of these old buildings while there are clear signs that the new ones foster crime, overcapacitate infrastructure, do not respond to housing & office space demands (too expensive), and destroy the cultural identity and liveability of the central city areas. Therefore: is it possible to add a marker for endangered building?",4,1,Diane Barbé,"No, not in this fashion as this is a tool for errors only.  There is a specific tag for that: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building:condition. This would be the correct way to map such a feature. In case of questions, you are better of asking in one of the forums: forum.osm.org. Cheers, 30303020"
