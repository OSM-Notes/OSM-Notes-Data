As this is north of the river it's possible that 'name' perhaps ought to be the same as 'name:sr' rather than 'name:sq'.  For info I'm a member of OpenStreetMap's Data Working Group (data@osmfoundation.org) which has tried to resolve issues such as this in the past - if you have a view that you want to put across please don't hesitate to contact us.
