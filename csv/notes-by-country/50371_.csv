Most older doors are made from wood, a material that has the warm, natural look and feel that most people prefer but is vulnerable to the elements. Season after season of sun and rain eventually warp, crack and bow wood, as the sun’s ultraviolet rays break down wood’s natural lignin, and moisture repeatedly shrinks and swells wood fibers. As a result, when given enough time, wood doors give up the ghost. Luckily, entry and exterior doors have changed significantly over the past few years. Homeowners may now select from a vast smorgasbord of options. Hundreds of types and sizes are available, from conventional wood models to high-tech alternatives made of fiberglass composites or steel to doors that incorporate a combination of these materials. One significant change with entry doors is that, unless you’re looking for a bare-bones door replacement, you can now buy an entire “entry system.” With an entry system, a door is pre-hung in its frame, the door’s bottom edge interlocks with the threshold, and weather stripping encircles the door’s perimeter. The hinges and lockset are designed as part of the system, and sidelites often flank the door. With a system, all components are designed and machined to work together reliably and energy efficiently. When buying a wood door, look for high-quality woods, durable finishes, and careful detailing. As a rule, the more intricate the carvings and moldings, and the thicker and wider the stiles and rails, the better the door. Nord’s high-end models have 1 3/8-inch panels; lesser priced doors have 9/16-inch and 3/4-inch panels.",2,0,kartonage,spam

Nun zur Küche: Ein absoluter Tipp ist der Lemon-Mint-Juice welcher die beste selbergmachte Limonade ist die ich je getrunken habe.  Von der Speisekarte haben wir das meiste durchprobiert und wir fanden ALLES lecker auch wenn wir das meiste noch nicht kannten. Von unseren 3 Tagen in Hsipaw waren wir ausnahmslos jeden Tag dort, auch wenn's nur für ein Getränk war. Die Menschen dort sind einfach super freundlich und sogar die Kinder üben ihr Englisch mit den Gästen und laden zu einer netten Konversation ein. Wirklich ein toller Garten!'
