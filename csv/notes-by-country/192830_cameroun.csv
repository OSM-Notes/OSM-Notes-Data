Nurse on duty Stephanie Ako said she is waiting for directives on what should be done.  'What we have to do now is to clean their wounds and stop blood from oozing out while waiting for doctors and laboratory technicians. They are the ones to decide if the fingers have to be amputated or not, but their lives are not in danger even though some of them have completely fractured phalanges, metacarpal and carpal bones,' she said.  The six are workers on a rubber plantation near Tiko owned by the Cameroon Development Corporation. 27-year old Christopher Ongene said armed men attacked them Saturday evening.  'The people arrived when we were packing our bags and farm tools to leave. One of them shouted, how many times have we asked you not to work here again. Then one of them ordered us to put our hands on tree trunks and they started cutting. Some of our colleagues who wanted to escape were shot,' he said.  Ongene said they were accused of defying instructions from the separatists not to go to work on the farms to protest President Biya's reelection and his expected inauguration on November 6. https://www.voanews.com/a/armed-groups-attack-cameroon-plantation-workers/4643961.html",2,0,freebeer,not a map error

The abduction in Kumba comes almost a fortnight after nearly 80 students were safely returned after being taken from a school in the neighboring region. Cameroon's North-West and South-West provinces have been hit by a separatist rebellion since last year. Armed groups have called on local residents to boycott schools until a referendum on independence is held.

The private school is on the outskirts of Kumba, in the South-West region's Meme district, and is surrounded by rubber plantations, he says. A separate source at the school confirmed the abduction to the BBC. A spokesperson for Meme, Ebane Kome Slesor, has told journalists the security forces have opened an investigation in a bid to free the abductees.  In the incident earlier this month in the North-West regional capital Bamenda, the government had accused separatists of being behind that kidnapping. The Anglophone separatists denied they were involved. The students kidnapped in Bamenda spent a few days in captivity The secessionist movement took up arms last year to demand independence for the North-West and South-West regions - the two English-speaking regions in a country where French is the most widely spoken official language.
