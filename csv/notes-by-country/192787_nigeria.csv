Quick Identification Tips when driving: • After passing the Papalanto cement factories and Ewekoro, look out for Akinale village signboards. • The Baptist Church and Primary School are almost opposite each other across the dual carriageway. • You will see village markets, petrol stations, and local shops clustered around this junction. Akinale is a growing rural community known for its proximity to Lafarge and Dangote cement factories, making it a common stop for travelers and truck drivers on the Abeokuta–Lagos route."
