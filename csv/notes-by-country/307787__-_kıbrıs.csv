Водопад является частью Национального парка Троодос, охраняемого законами Республики Кипр.  По одной из версий, свое название водопад получил благодаря одному из шотландцев в далеком 1878 году. Он утверждал, что ландшафт вокруг кипрского водопада напоминает ему его далекую Шотландию, которая в древности носила название Каледония. История не сохранила имени шотландца, сравнившего Кипр со своей родиной, однако за водопадом закрепилось название Каледонского.  По другой, английской версии связывают происхождение  имени Каледония  с ласточками, якобы, обитающими в кронах деревьев в районе водопада. Оказывается, chelidon  urbica  - латинское название городской ласточки. Вот такая выстраивается цепочка: челидон, келидон, Каледония.. Дорога к водопаду извилиста, часто пересекает реку, но все места бродов оборудованы деревянными мостиками. Тропу сопровождает красивая густая растительность из кустарников (барбарис, шиповник) и деревьев (дуб, клен, ольха, платан, земляничное дерево), увитых плющом. Неспешный путь по лесу до водопада занимает около 30-40 минут. Рядом с самим водопадом оборудованы места для отдыха, выложены ступеньки из камня для комфортного перемещения.'

Николаю. Место было найдено рядом с морем, с видом на живописную (как, собственно, и все гавани Кипра) марину.  Часовня, воздвигнутая в греческом стиле в виде белоснежной постройки под синим куполом, обращена к открытому морскому простору. Со стороны моря, обойдя храм по окружающей его площадке, мы обнаружили памятный знак (он же «Символ многовековой дружбы России и Кипра», установленный в 2011 году, — пять лет спустя после памятного Креста возле храма Всех Святых Кипра близ монастыря Ставровуни), где было указано: на расстоянии 350 м от берега, под толщей вод Средиземного моря на глубине 15 м установлен подводный памятник — мемориальный каменный крест в память о всех невернувшихся моряках. Эту миссию в рамках акции «European roots» (она взяла начало в Германии, с остановками в 13 странах и с конечным пунктом назначения на Кипре — самой «восточной» точке Европы) выполнила команда российского круизного парусника «Бегущая по волнам».'

And we do not subscribe to the philosophy of mass-produced apartments and row upon row of look-alike houses. With more than 35 years’ experience in the Cyprus property market, we are proud of our ‘local’ status. We remain committed to seeing the southern coast of Cyprus enhance its reputation as a highly sought-after destination for investors, businesses and pleasure seekers through carefully-planned property development – without adversely impacting the natural environment that Cyprus has to offer. As developers, we understand that we are only ever as good as our last project – so rather than rest on our past successes, we consistently invest in our own evolution. By focusing on our key strengths and innate ability to foresee the trends in real estate, Sunshadow has clearly identified the optimum strategic areas for future growth.
