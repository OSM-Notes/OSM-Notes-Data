After further inspection of the NtM, the 'NtM 1/38 - 2017 cancelled' most likely means that the *previous* version of the notice is cancelled.  In the Dutch version it's clearer: the 2019 version says 'BaZ 2018-1/38 vervalt'.  So I restored this area, but I left off the landuse=military so it won't be rendered in the default style."
