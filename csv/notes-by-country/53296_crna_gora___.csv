Unfortunately, Google is not valid source, and we can't use it for contributions on OSM, I will not look at it, but rather ignore it and work with available imageries and info which you have explained.  I think you provided enough info, considering how you said that you know owner who sold it, and you are certain that new owners demolished building. Plus you were there on the spot and took picture from corner of the street where building is missing. I think that makes it clear to make appopriate changes.  I have decided to add lifecycle prefix to the building, stating that it has been demolished. I did that rather than just simply deleting it, because building can still be seen on some aerial imageries, so to prevent people readding it again after deletion, this seems like best solution. At least until imageries are not updated, or new building is constructed. :)  You can see the changes here: https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/193644927"
