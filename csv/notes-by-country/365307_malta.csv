It tells the story of the last trip of the Apostle towards Rome in 60AD, towards the sentence of his martyrdom because of his conversion to Christianity. As a Roman citizen he had the right to appear in front of Caesar and be judged in Rome. It is an experience of what Saint Paul had to go through to arrive to Malta and how this had changed its history forever. It also shows today’s places that are related to this story of the shipwreck and the three months stay of the Apostle on the Maltese islands.  This 35 minutes docudrama is projected using a new technology of multiple projectors on a 13m long screen (120° viewing). The idea is to create an experience of what Saint Paul had to go through to arrive to Malta, involving the viewer in the story so as to be part of it and not just remaining a passive viewer.  The show can be watched in 6 different languages: Maltese, English, French, Italian, German & Spanish. (OSM data version: 2016-05-10T14:41:03Z) #mapsme",2,0,mikefalzon,
