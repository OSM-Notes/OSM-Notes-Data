You also gain a knowledge-based appraisal because we believe that ‘old school’ is a good thing – especially when it comes to pre-purchase and pre-sale inspections. As a registered, Licensed Building Practitioner covering all commercial and residential buildings, Fairview’s principal building inspector Rob Cane takes the time to talk through his reports and explain any issues during what can be a stressful, confusing time for buyers and sellers. Fairview refuses to take anything at face value because 95% of the time building issues and defects are more than skin deep.

Our team approaches each job with empathy and efficiency, ensuring a hassle-free junk removal process.

Aluminium is an excellent conductor of heat and therefore an extremely poor insulator. uPVC has been applied in North America, Europe, as well as the UK since the 1970s, and over 80% of homes in Europe and the UK now have uPVC doors and windows.   Warmer uPVC windows are perfect for helping keep your house warmer in winter and cooler in summer.   uPVC accomplishes around 63% better than aluminium and around 25% better than even thermally broken aluminium.   LEARN MORE Quieter In addition to being an effective thermal insulator, our uPVC frames are also an extremely effective barrier to noise.   Your home will not only be warmer in winter and cooler in summer, but quieter too.   LEARN MORE Durable Our uPVC profiles are built to withstand 40 years or more in New Zealand conditions.   uPVC won't rot, rust or corrode, does not need painting, and can simply be cleaned using soapy water.",2,0,ecoaucklandnz,

Started through Daniel Ebbett in 2016, BlockBlueLight was born out of a demand to take care of his worrying health problems.  After learning about all the dangerous impacts that over exposure to artificial blue light may cause such as digital eye strain and sleep disruption, blockbluelight created the best blue light glasses and computer glasses that eliminate headaches and eye strain and support along with maximizing melatonin ranks and sleep quality. Their Blue Light Blocking Glasses and Anti Blue Light Computer glasses as the leading offered for blocking blue light  We have an eager and committed research and development team that has considering that established a wider variety of glasses for separate scenarios along with a suite of various lighting products to cut out more resources of blue light and boost overall health, including nursery night lights, blue blocking torches, reading lamps, and a large variety of different blue blocking light bulbs for different circumstances. In fact, these days, our specialty non-blue light emitting light bulbs are some of the products which our customers love the most! Rather than block certain spectrums of light, it's often far more efficient to just not emit blue light at all.",2,0,BlockBlueLight NZ,

Singles discover just how to date consciously and attract their ideal partner. Singles overcome their fear of dating and repeating the very same mistakes by getting involved in another lousy relationship. They become the chooser of their next relationship whilst successfully navigating red flags, developing dating confidence, preventing time-wasting relationships, and having a clear vision of their ideal partner. Through coaching, couples have the ability to identify and overcome limiting beliefs that cause problem in their relationships. They breathe new life into their relationship with improved communication and having healthy boundaries. Couples have the ability to develop an extra loving and intimate connection with their loved one and make more empowered options, whilst reducing conflict and competition for power in the relationship. For singles who are not searching for an intimate relationship, the Successful Singles coaching program promotes and supports individuals that want to develop a positive and loving relationship with themselves. This program is particularly helpful for people that have actually recently been in a consuming relationship, or with a violent partner, and become 'lost' and need to find themselves once again.",2,0,coachtwoconct,

Er liegt auch im Fiordland-Nationalpark und führt durch bemooste Regenwälder und Steppen. Dabei überquert er viele Flüsse über Hängebrücken und du kannst so viele Wasserfälle wie auf keinem anderen der Great Walks sehen. Auf einer kurzen Seitenroute bietet der Wanderweg einen sensationellen Ausblick auf den Sutherland Wasserfall – einen der höchsten und beeindruckendsten Wasserfälle Neuseelands. Auf der Wanderung geht es auch über 1.000 Meter hoch auf den Mackinnon-Pass, wo du tolle Aussichten über das Fjordland hast.  Weil er durch eine so einzigartige und abwechslungsreiche Landschaft führt, gelten auf dem Milford Track aber auch die strengsten Regeln. Zum einen darfst du den Track nur in eine Richtung gehen und zwar von Te Anau aus bis zum Milford Sound. An beiden Enden musst du ein Boot nehmen. Zum anderen darfst du maximal vier Tage für die Strecke brauchen, da es nur drei Übernachtungsplätze gibt. Das Campen ist auf dem ganzen Weg verboten, die Hütten kosten 54 Dollar pro Nacht. Außerdem sind die Besucherzahlen pro Tag auf 90 Personen limitiert, weshalb dieser Wanderweg meist schon Monate im Voraus ausgebucht ist – zumindest in der Hauptsaison. In den neuseeländischen Wintermonaten musst du nicht vorbuchen und die Übernachtung kostet nur 15 Dollar. Allerdings gibt es aufgrund des schlechteren Wetters das Risiko von Überschwemmungen und sogar Lawinengefahr! Generell ist der Milford Track aufgrund seiner vielen Höhenmeter sehr anspruchsvoll, sollte aber in der Nebensaison nur von erfahrenen Outdoorern begangen werden.  http://www.doc.govt.nz/milfordtrack (OSM data version: 2017-01-19T15:17:02Z) #mapsme",2,0,Hamish Kirkman,
