Follow the road through some fields and across a bridge until you encounter a canal and a village. You will see signs for an “amazing” cave. At the intersection, make a right and follow the path along the canal for a while, passing the previously advertised Pha Thao cave. From here there are a couple routes, but the simplest is to continue toward the signposted water cave. Just before the water cave there is a Y-junction where you’ll want to make a left and follow this path until you come across a clearing with a pavilion and some toilets. The approximate GPS coordinates are 19°02'20.6N 102°25'25.7E.). These two caves together offer several hours of great adventuring away from the more commonly visited caves nearer to Vang Vieng. While Tham Loub offers some impressive columns and a lovely, albeit short, walk, Tham Hoi will likely occupy most of your time. A large Buddha statue sits just inside the entrance, and, continuing past it, you can walk along the relatively flat path for 10-15 minutes until the cave narrows considerably, after which you will need to be prepared to get wet and muddy on your hands and knees to continue. Depending on your pace, you can spend a good 2-3 hours exploring the cave to the end, enjoying some impressive flowstone formations along the way. And while the corridors are fairly flat, some areas will require a bit of scrambling as well as squeezing through narrow openings on your belly. Bring a headlamp and batteries. If you arrive before 5 pm, you may encounter some locals near the entrances demanding 10,000 kip for a headlamp and the right to continue. While this is typical for Laos, be aware that, after paying, someone may accompany you into Tham Hoi unsolicited and lead you in for a few minutes before demanding 30,000-50,000 more for his “guide” ser",2,0,30303020,This feature is available for mapping errors.
