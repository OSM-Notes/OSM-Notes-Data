It's was a village among 3 historical communities Thimi, Bode and Nagadesh. About 18 years ago, these 3 historical villages along with some neighbouring newly developed villages were merged together to form a municipality called Madhyapur municipality . People were as well as are calling this place Nagadesh from the very beginning .  So, I , being a local resident of this place, suggest you all to mark this place as a community named Nagadesh. Its really odd to see my own community's name is missing in the world map. While many newly developed communities are named and marked correctly,  a historical place is not even marked or named.

One day two people of Newari ethnicity from a nearby settlement came to Parthali, near the boundaries of Dhunkharka and Chalal. From there they saw a tiger sleeping in an open space now known as Narayantar. Based on what they saw, they named the place Dhunkharka. In Newari language, ‘Dhun’ means ‘Tiger’ and ‘Kharka” means ‘settlement’. Thus, Dhunkharka means ‘place of tiger settlement’ or ‘home of tigers’ in Newari.   The local timezone is named 'Asia / Kathmandu' with an UTC offset of 5.75 hours. Depending on your mobility, While being here, you might want to check out and Panaoti as well. We know of 5 airports close to Dhungkharka.

One day two people of Newari ethnicity from a nearby settlement came to Parthali, near the boundaries of Dhunkharka and Chalal. From there they saw a tiger sleeping in an open space now known as Narayantar. Based on what they saw, they named the place Dhunkharka. In Newari language, ‘Dhun’ means ‘Tiger’ and ‘Kharka” means ‘settlement’. Thus, Dhunkharka means ‘place of tiger settlement’ or ‘home of tigers’ in Newari.

The people worshipped and prayed to the goddess Baglamukhi who, pleased by their prayers, came to their rescue and killed the demon. Hence, the people built the temple as a tribute to the goddess and used to call it Bagala. Later, the name of the temple was changed to Baglamukhi. The temple is ruled by the planet Jupiter and Thursday is considered as the special day for worshiping at the temple. It is also said that worshiping here silences the gossip of the people (enemy). She is also considered as Bhairavi, a type of Matrika Devi, the mother of all speech as she puts an end to the evil gossips that comes out of every speech. -- Banglamukhi, Patan (OSM data version: 2016-05-10T14:41:03Z) #mapsme",2,0,freebeer,personal maps. me bookmark not mapping info

As with some of your other notes I will say that the notes feature here is for requests for changes and additions to the map, not general info about a location.   I'm editing the map based on the fact that you point out it's an open field. I retagged it as a sports field, with the name 'Dhulikhel Stadium', so you should see it show up as green on most maps now. The name was already mapped so I didn't need to change anything there.  The info about kids and teenagers can not be represented within the OSM data, nor would I think it could on most maps."
