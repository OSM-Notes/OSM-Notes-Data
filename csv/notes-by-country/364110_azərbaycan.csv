I have noticed that on map there is solid division between Azerbaijan Republic and so called “Nagorno-Karabakh republic”. The problem occured when I started to use MAPS.ME app which based on OSM, where “NKR” was shown as independend republic with solid line division. While neighbour country Georgia who also has a occupied territories of Abkhazia and South Osetia wasn’t shown a solid line division between, but only dash lines, which indicates that this territories are disputed but still considered as Georgian territories.  I want to apply the same approach for Azerbaijan. “NKR” is not recognized by any country in the world and considered as Azerbaijan territory.  Please help me to fix it on map so it will appear on MAPS.ME not as solid division, but only dash line border.

Therefore you Are kindly requested to remove this wrong naming from Azerbaijani map. Moreover somehow the territory cities and regions are in Armenian language. I would like to note that it's not normal that you mention cities in Azerbaijan with Armenian letters. Can you please kindly change those mistakes and if possible advise   Thanks  Eivaz Eivaz@yahoo.com,2,0,DrDimedrol,նոնսենս

Most of the region is governed by the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, a de facto independent but unrecognized state established on the basis of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast within the Azerbaijan SSR of the Soviet Union. The territory is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan,[1][2] which has not exercised power over most of the region since 1991. Since the end of the Nagorno-Karabakh War in 1994, representatives of the governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan have been holding peace talks mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group on the region's disputed status.  The region is usually equated with the administrative borders of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast comprising an area of 4,400 square kilometres (1,700 sq mi).
