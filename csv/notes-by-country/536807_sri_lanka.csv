It spreads over more than 5000 acres of forest on the ‘Dummiya’ mountain range, and is residence to about 100 Buddhist monks. Ven Angulgamuwa Ariyananda Mahāthera serves as the abbot and main meditation teacher. The meditative technique follows closely the system of Ven Pah Auk Sayadaw of Myanmar, where many of the resident monks have undertaken extensive training. Additionally, Ven Pah Auk Sayadaw himself has visited repeatedly and even spent many months on retreat at Na Uyana. (OSM data version: 2016-08-22T09:03:02Z) #mapsme",2,0,SL_Mapper,
