This road has couse problem in the past when a good hearted person has change it classification so it turns up on navigation as best way to Ísafjörður and tourist have gotten stuck in snow up there with no mobile service. In a similar road in this aria people were stuck for 2 days before they were rescued.

And driven back and forth form Reykjavík thousand's of times.  The forest is called Skyggnis-skógur or Skyggnis-forest. It draws its name from lava rocks with a good view over the forest (Gott Skyggni = good view). When the kids (a looong time ago) were sent to gather the calf's, sheep or horses grazing in the forest they ran first to this small cliff to get a 'good view' over the forest. From this is the name (noun) Skyggnir - From which the forest gets it name.  When I was drawing the cottage roads and part of the walkways, paths and roads I marked this as a notable viewing-point and POI because of this connection. Then there was a good path to this small cliff, but no tourist marking or anything. The fencing around is always open for people walking about - To look for horses... Fencing is for the sheep, cows and horses, also not at least the trucks that arrive there at wintertime to clean out valuables.  I do not doubt that from the Treasure-chest (Gullkista) over Knife-planes (Hnífavellir) you would also get a good view - Even better if you climbed Bjarnafell (where each crevasse has its name), and a 'Castle' on its top.  POI are by hundreds in every place, some are of interest to others, some are hidden (falcon and eagle nests). For example the tiny bit of road there close called Kóngsvegur 'The kings road' has a much longer and bigger history - I think there was even a book written about it - Perhaps it will become a famous walking-path in the future.  Maybe this was just my sandcastle for markings, and someone went wild over this! - But not over other markings and drawings in the area !?   If you want guidance to the place I live there close by, #16 - Hardly able to walk now but the brain is OK.  Regards, Pjetur"

This type of note is only intended as a way to communicate mapping errors and omissions. Sometimes the difference between a personal note and one indicating a mapping omission is subtle, but if your note looks like it may have been added as a way to create a marker for private or publicity purposes you may find that another OpenStreetMap contributor 'resolves' the note (which means it's been marked as dealt with)."
